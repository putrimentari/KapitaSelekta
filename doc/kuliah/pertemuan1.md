The Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for cryptographic data communications network to a secure command line interface, login, remote execution commands, and other network services between two computer networks. Is connected, via a secure channel or through the network is not secure, server and client run a SSH server and SSHclient programs in each. Protocol specification distinguishes between two main versions are referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2.

The most well-known application of this Protocol is to shell access to your accounton a Unix-like operating systems, but can also be used in the same way for accountson Windows. It was designed as a replacement for Telnet and other remote shell protocol that is not as safe as the Berkeley rsh and rexec Protocol, which send information, notably passwords, in plain text, making them vulnerable to interception and disclosure using the Analyzer package. The encryption used by SSH is intended to provide confidentiality and integrity of data over an insecure network, such as the Internet.
